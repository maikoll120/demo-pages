## What is Multi-Factor Authentication? v4
MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification in addition to your password. This helps protect your account even if your password is compromised.

## Which method should I use?
Authenticator apps are generally more secure than SMS, as they're not vulnerable to SIM swapping attacks. However, SMS is more convenient if you don't have your phone with you.

## How does this protect me?
Even if someone gains access to your password, they won't be able to log in without the second factor. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access to your account.
